        <tr>
            <th><!--item-->Video Games!</th>
            <td><!--description--> I typically play multiplayer games including: 
                shooter, team based games like Call of Duty and Overwatch.
                I also play survival and open world games that include Dead by Daylight and Minecraft.
                Usually I only play around 3 or 4 games at a time but they'll rotate around as time passes, 
                especially as updates and new games release.
                I usually play on the playstation platform, although i have used Vr and Pc platforms.
                I usually play Blade and sorcery on Vr and usually Valorant or Lethal Company on Pc. </td>

            <th><!--item-->Anime!</th>
            <td><!--description--> I watch a lot of anime although i have a habit of not finishing them.
                typically i watch either action or slice of life type shows.
                Some examples are One Piece, DanDaDan, and Shangri-La Frontier.
                Because Animes typically release on a seasonal schedule the slice of life type of animes I watch are usually dependant on what is being released
                and slice of life is general term im using since some will go into action, comedy, or even romance occasionally. </td>

            <td colspan="3"><!--description--> I have decently broad interest in science fields. 
                Typically resulting in just interesting facts about certain phenomenon like black holes and nuclear physics.
                I also have a interest in tech I like understanding how it works especially things relating to black holes and nuclear physics
                like how a nuclear bomb would go off and why it would and its effects, as one example. </td>
