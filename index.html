            <td><!--description--> I typically play multiplayer games including: 
                shooter, team based games like Call of Duty and Overwatch.
                I also play survival and open world games that include Dead by Daylight and Minecraft.
                Usually I only play around 3 or 4 games at a time but they'll rotate around as time passes, 
                especially as updates and new games release.
                I usually play on the playstation platform, although i have used Vr and Pc platforms.
                I usually play Blade and sorcery on Vr and usually Valorant or Lethal Company on Pc. </td>
